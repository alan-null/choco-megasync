# Secure Global Access

Your data is accessible anytime. Use a web browser or one of our powerful apps, available for all major platforms.


# End-to-End Encryption

Unlike most other cloud storage providers, only you control who has access to your data. Not even MEGA can access it!


# Secure Collaboration

Share data and communicate with your contacts securely, and see their updates in real time.


# Massive Storage Space

Not only are we more secure than our major competitors, we also provide a more generous amount of free storage.


# Live Encrypted Backup

With our real-time file synchronisation and versioning features, your data is always safe and recoverable.


# Public Source Code

To enable independent verification of the correctness and integrity of our crypto model and its implementation, we publish the full source code of our client apps.
